# ASP.Net-CRUD-Application-with-Random-data
 This is my first asp.net crud application with create, edit, delete items feature. all with random data about products stored in a database. all the products have id, price, desription and a picture(taken randomly according to the 1st word of the product name).
there are 2 other cotrollers here: UsersController and MovieController. The movie controller also has a database with movie name, rating and genre with random values.
This was my 1st ASP.NET framework practice.
